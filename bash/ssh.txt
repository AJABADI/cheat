# Misc
* ProxyCommand: command which is executed when 'ssh host' is typed

# Port fowarding
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding
* Local port forwarding:
  ssh -L 5901:dest:5900 hn01
  -> forward localhost:5901 to dest:5900 on hn01
* Reverse port forward
  ssh -R 5901:dest:5900 hn01
  -> open conntection to hn01
  -> if there is a connection on hn01 to localhost:5901
     forward it to dest:5900 on the current host
* Dynamic port forward
  ssh -D 1080 hn01
  -> current host becomes a SOCKS proxy listening on port 1080
  -> every connection x:y on localhost is forwarded to x:y on hn01
