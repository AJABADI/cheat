# Groups
* Data Groups: technical replicates (same cell)
* Replicates sets: biological replicates (same tissue)

# Strands
* Red strand: left -> right (top) +
* Blue strand: right -> left (bottom) -

# Quantification pipelines
* Read count quantifications: How many reads overlap with probe
* Base pair quantifications: How many base pairs of read overlap with probe
* Enrichment quantifications: How many more reads overlap with probe than
  expected by chance
* Difference quantification: Difference strands
* Coverage quantification: Which % of the probe is covered
* Coverage depth quantification: Overlap of reads within probe

# Plots
* Probe value histogram
* Box Whiskerplot
* Scatterplot
* Probe trend plot: distribution quantification within all probes
* Aligned probes plot: distribution quantification within individual probes
